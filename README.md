## üöÄ Features

- Team and match entities with dynamic stats
- Round-robin fixture generation (supports 4 teams)
- Week-by-week match simulation with realistic goal calculation
- League table with advanced tie-breaker rules (points, goal difference, head-to-head, goals for, name)
- Monte Carlo‚Äìbased champion probability calculation and DB storage
- PostgreSQL database support (persistent data)
- Full RESTful API with Gin
- Easy reset for new seasons (without resetting team IDs)
- Modular, layered architecture (entity, repository, service, controller/api)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Run

1. **Install Go 1.22+ and PostgreSQL.**
2. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/league-simulation.git
   cd league-simulation

3. Install dependencies:

   go mod download

4. Configure your database connection in repository/db.go
(Set your POSTGRES_DSN, e.g., postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/yourdb?sslmode=disable)

5. Create your database schema (see below).

6. Run the server:
   
   go run main.go

The API will be available at: http://localhost:8080

## üí° Example API Requests

Create a fixture:
  POST http://localhost:8080/create-fixture

Simulate week 1:
  POST http://localhost:8080/simulate-week/1

Get league table:

## üß™ Testing

Run all tests:

  go test ./test

## üìù Notes

  All endpoints return JSON.

  All business logic is decoupled via interface-based repository pattern.

  The API is stateless; no session/cookie is required.

  Only 4 teams are currently supported for fixture creation (can be improved for general N).
